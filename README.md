=========================  
For Kerbal Space Program 1.12.X

## Description

The Boeing F/A-18F Super Hornet is a twin-engine, carrier-capable, multirole fighter aircraft variant based on the
McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet. The F/A-18F tandem-seat variant is a larger and more advanced derivative of the F/A-18D Hornet.

Included is the VFA-103 "Jolly Rogers" Livery, I may do other Strike Fighter Squadron Liveries if there is demand.
